# Unet : multiple classification using Keras

This is a modified project from the two-class(cell and background) [zhixuhao/unet](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet.git) here. The main purpose of this project is establishing a process of multiple classification. Here are 3 classes, dog, cat and background and I open the labelled images. Try it!

### 2019/09/13 update : Quick Start

I simplified my code and now make training much easier.
Once you want to run training, you can just pass some parameters in command line like below after you build up your own dev environment:
```
python3 main.py -n 001 -lr 0.00004 -ldr 0.000008 -b 16 -s 60 -e 80
```

-n   = A number helps save different .h5 and directories of infered images.  
-lr  = learning rate  
-ldr = learning decay rate  
-b   = batch size  
-s   = steps  
-e   = epochs  
(check more params in mode/config.py)

### You have to know:
The structure of this project is:

/data/catndog : my sample collection of cat and dog with the [required catalog](https://gist.github.com/fchollet/0830affa1f7f19fd47b06d4cf89ed44d). 

All you have see are defined as below:
* data.py : prepare the related images you want to train and predict.
* model.py : define the U-net structure
* main.py : run the program


### data.py

My original size of images is 512x512. However, they'll be resized to 256x256 for U-net architecture defined in model.py. I collect the sample images of cats and dogs from internet. You can find my sample data in /data/catndog/. However, /catndog/ just show how to put your data. You can prepare your data by your own.

My modifications are summerized below:

* in def trainGenerator(), at first, comment "classes". Second, set the target directories as train_path+"image" in image_datagen.flow_from_directory() and train_path+"label" in mask_datagen.flow_from_directory(). Keras will detect the classes from your training data automatically.

* Let all the "flag_multi_class = True"

* in def adjustdata(), reshape the mask with (batch_size, width, height, classes). Every channel in fourth dimemsion corresponds to a certain class with one-hot format. This repo only written for 3 classes(cat, dog, background).

* in labelVsiualize(), pick up the max value in one-hot vector and draw the corresponding colors to every gnenerated all-zero array. You can define the color in clolor_dict.

### model.py

All the U-net architecture is defined in model.py .


### main.py

Training and test steps are defined in main.py .


### My dependencies

* Tensorflow : 1.4.0
* Keras >= 1.0
* Python 3.5.2
* cuda 8.0 (for my Nvidia GTX980ti)


(it's optional, but I recommend that):

* docker 18.09.5



If there is any other suggestion, do not hesitate to tell me.
